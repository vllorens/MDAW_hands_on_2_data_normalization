# Hands-on #1: "from raw data to OTU table"

This is the repo for the first hands-on tutorial in the Microbiome Data Analyses Workshop (https://mdawo.meetinghand.com/). In this tutorial, I will give a brief introduction on how high throughput 16S data is generated. Then, I will explain how from a single fastq file we can obtain the *demultiplexed* files for the different samples. 

Then, we will follow an R markdown document in which we will go from demultiplexed fastq files to an ASV table using the DADA2 pipeline. I will also explain what are the similarities and differences between OTUs and ASVs.

Here, you will find:

- `hands_on_from_raw_data_to_otu_table.Rproj`: the R project from within we will follow the tutorial
- `hands_on_1_data_preprocessing.Rmd`: the tutorial as a R markdown notebook that can be compiled into an html file
- `hands_on_1_data_preprocessing.html`: the compiled version of this tutorial
- a `data/` folder: where so far, you have only the RDP training sets for taxonomic assignment 
- a `scripts/` folder: contains a script version of the Rmd file
- a `docs/` folder: contains images needed to compile the Rmd document
- this `README.md` file
